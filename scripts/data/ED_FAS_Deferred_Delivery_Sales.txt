## Preface

PR1 Deferred delivery sales and development contracts based on Salam and Istisna are amongst the
unique products of Islamic finance, having a significant proportion in the Islamic finance transactions
in different markets. Due to multiple unique transaction structures based on Salam and Istisna, and
certain Shari’ah compliance issues in their implementation, the financial reporting requirements for
the same is always a challenge.

PR2 AAOIFI had earlier addressed these unique financial reporting requirements in the AAOIFI Financial
Accounting Standard (FAS) 7 “Salam and Parallel Salam” and FAS 10 “Istisna’a and Parallel Istisna’a”,
which were identified for revision and improvement as a result of a comprehensive FAS review and
revision project initiated by AAOIFI Accounting Board (AAB / the board).

PR3 This standard aims at setting out the financial reporting principles for recognising, measuring,
presenting and disclosing the transactions of deferred delivery sales (including transactions based on
Salam and Istisna) that are carried out by both, the buyers and the sellers of such transactions.

PR4 This standard, along with the [ED of] FAS __ “Istisna-based Development Contracts”, supersedes the
earlier FAS 7 “Salam and Parallel Salam” and FAS 10 “Istisna’a and Parallel Istisna’a”.


## Introduction

### Overview

IN1 This standard prescribes the accounting and financial reporting principles for recognition,
measurement, presentation and disclosures related to deferred delivery sales transactions,
applicable to the buyers and sellers for such transactions. Such transactions include both, Salam and
Istisna based deferred delivery sales transactions, but do not include Istisna-based development
contracts which are subject of another standard being simultaneously issued.

### Rationale for issuing this standard

IN2 In line with the financial accounting standards (FASs) development strategy, AAOIFI Accounting
Board (AAB / the board) initiated a review and revision process for certain FASs, including FASs
addressing the accounting and financial reporting issues of Salam and Istisna transactions. Such
process and additional time-to-time feedback received from the market participants, revealed that
certain aspects of the newer market practices and the changes and updates in the generally
accepted accounting principles need to be incorporated in the relevant FASs. In addition, a need was
felt to align certain requirements with the newer FASs and the revised framework. Accordingly, it
was considered imperative to revise the existing FASs dealing with Salam and Istisna transactions.

IN3 During the revision process, it was considered necessary by the board to prescribe the requirements
related to deferred delivery sales (including those based on Salam and Istisna), at one place, in order
to avoid duplication and confusion instead of two different standards. Nevertheless, it was also
considered that the development contracts based on Istisna justify a different accounting treatment
and, hence, the same need to be covered in a separate standard to be issued simultaneously with
this standard.

### Significant changes from the previous standard

IN4 This standard brings significant changes from its predecessor standards (FAS 7 “Salam and Parallel
Salam” and FAS 10 “Istisna’a and Parallel Istisna’a”), inter alia, in the following aspects:

a. the revised standard has been drafted after combining and aligning the requirements of two
earlier standards that addressed deferred delivery sales (including transactions based on
both, Salam and Istisna, excluding Istisna-based development contracts addressed in the
respective AAOIFI FAS^1 );
b. the financial reporting requirements prescribed by the revised standard are aligned with the
requirements related to control, transfer of control and revenue recognition as prescribed
by the conceptual framework and the relevant AAOIFI FASs;
c. the predecessor standards included certain Shari’ah requirements which have not been
included in the revised standard, and accordingly this standard shall be read in conjunction
with the respective AAOIFI Shari’ah Standards (SSs);
(^1) [ED of] FAS __ “Istisna-based Development Contracts”


d. the relevant definitions have been aligned with the definitions provided by the respective
AAOIFI SSs;
e. the revised standard prescribes the financial reporting requirements from both the buyer’s
and seller’s perspective, while the predecessor standards addressed the financial reporting
for the seller only;
f. the revised standard aligns the requirements relating to impairment, credit losses, net
realisable value (NRV) and onerous contracts, with the requirements of the respective
AAOIFI FAS^2 ;
g. the treatments and financial reporting requirements for parallel Salam and parallel Istisna
transactions have been simplified and are now based on the applicable treatments for the
seller and the buyer, respectively;
h. the agency related accounting treatments have been clarified in case of a deferred delivery
sale transaction structure involving an agent; and
i. accounting requirements with respect to subsequent changes in the terms of the contract or
in the goods, have been simplified.

**AAOIFI Financial Accounting Standard __**

**Deferred Delivery Sales**

## Objective of the standard

1. The objective of this standard is to prescribe the appropriate accounting and financial reporting
    principles for recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosures to apply in relation to
    deferred delivery sales transactions (comprising Salam and Istisna sales transaction (see paragraph
    5a)) for the buyers and sellers for such transactions.

## Scope

2. This standard applies to accounting and financial reporting for deferred delivery sales transactions
    carried out under Shari’ah principles and rules^3 by the Islamic financial institutions (IFIs / the
    institutions) and other institutions following AAOIFI Financial Accounting Standards (FASs), except
    for those Istisna transactions that are excluded from the scope under paragraph 3.
3. This standard shall not apply to Istisna-based development contracts^4.
4. This standard shall also not apply to such Istisna transactions whereby the institution, being a buyer
    of the subject-matter, has intentions to either:

a. lease out and eventually sell (or otherwise transfer) the subject-matter under Ijarah
Muntahia Bittamleek arrangement, to be accounted for in line with the requirements of the
respective AAOIFI FAS^5 ; or
b. use the subject-matter in its own operations (self-use or self-consumption).
## Definitions

5. For the purpose of interpreting and applying this standard, the following short definitions are
    relevant:

a. Deferred delivery sales – are the sales transactions carried out in line with Shari’ah principles
and rules, based on either Salam or Istisna contract, whereby the primary performance
obligation under the respective contract is delivery of the subject-matter. Deferred delivery
sales do not include such sales transactions that are promised to be carried out on a specific
future date against a unilateral promise or undertaking to sell or purchase, which are
consummated through an offer and acceptance on such future date, in line with Shari’ah
principles and rules;
(^3) See paragraph 8(k) of FAS 1 “General Presentation and Disclosures in the Financial Statements”
(^4) See [ED of] FAS __ “Istisna-based Development Contracts”
(^5) FAS 32 “Ijarah”


b. Istisna – is a contract to sell a described asset with deferred delivery based on a
manufacturing request. In practicality, it is a sale contract between the buyer and the seller
whereby the seller, based on an order from the buyer, undertakes to manufacture, have it /
get it manufactured or otherwise acquire the subject-matter of the contract according to the
specifications and sell it to the buyer for an agreed upon price and method of settlement
whether that be in advance, by instalments or deferred to a specific future time;
c. Istisna-based development contract^6 – is a contract of Istisna for development of an asset
meeting the criteria as defined in respective AAOIFI FAS^7 ;
d. Parallel Salam – is an arrangement whereby the seller enters into another independent
Salam contract with a third party to acquire goods, the specification of which corresponds to
that of the subject-matter specified in the first Salam contract, so as to fulfil the obligation
under the first Salam contract, without making the execution of the second Salam contract
dependent on the execution of the first one. In contemporary custom, such second contract
is called parallel Salam [Explanation: In practice, the sequence of the execution of the two
independent Salam transactions may vary according to the transaction structure];
e. Parallel Istisna – is an arrangement whereby the seller / developer enters into another
independent Istisna contract with a third party to acquire (through manufacturing /
development) the subject-matter according to the specifications of the subject-matter
specified in the first Istisna contract as to fulfil the obligation under the first Istisna contract.
In contemporary custom, such second contract is called parallel Istisna. Parallel Istisna is
executed only if so allowed by the buyer / customer under the first Istisna contract, without
making the execution of the second Istisna contract dependent on the execution of the first
one [Explanation: In practice, the sequence of the execution of the two independent Istisna
transactions may vary according to the transaction structure]; and
f. Salam^8 – is the sale of a (pre-specified) commodity for deferred delivery in exchange for
immediate payment in full, in line with Shari’ah principles and rules [Explanation: It is a type
of sale in which the price, known as the Salam capital, is paid at the time of contracting
while the delivery of the subject-matter is deferred to a specific time].
(^6) [ED of] FAS __ “Istisna-based Development Contracts”
(^7) Paragraph 5 of [ED of] FAS __ “Istisna-based Development Contracts” states “Istisna-based development contract,
within the scope of this standard, is a contract of Istisna for development of an asset (normally, an item of property,
plant and equipment or investment property), duly meeting the following criteria: a. it involves a significant element of
efforts on the part of the developer, including labour and services (which needs to be compensated for in the event of
force majeure, in line with Shari’ah principles and rules and customary practices); b. it has either an element of partial
control transfer through milestones-based delivery and / or construction / development on the customer’s owned
property or, otherwise, defines multiple performance obligations as a part of the contract that may individually be
assessed and used as criteria for determining stage of completion; c. the subject-matter is intended to address certain
specific needs of an identified unique customer and hence, may generally not have a ready market or may not be in a
condition, position or location suited for its sale to a third party; and d. it has a considerable original total development
period (comprising of a single or multiple phases or tranches). [Explanation: Development period, in the specific context
of this definition criteria, shall not be confused with, or considered interchangeable with, the deferred delivery
period.]”
(^8) Also referred to as Salaf (having the literal meanings of borrowing)


## Deferred delivery sales in the books of the buyer

### Initial recognition

#### Advance for Salam goods and advance for Istisna goods

#### Advance for Salam goods and advance for Istisna goods

6. Advance cash payments made by the buyer (to the customer, in the capacity of the seller in the
    Salam or Istisna transaction) shall be recognised, as follows:

a. in case of a Salam transaction – at the time of entering into a Salam contract as advance for
Salam goods, equivalent to the amount of cash paid; and
b. in case of an Istisna transaction – as and when the advance payment(s) is made (in lump
sum, or in instalments), if any, in line with the contractual arrangements, as advance for
Istisna goods equivalent to the amount of cash paid.
#### Inventories

7. Inventory shall be recognised by the buyer once it controls the subject-matter of the Salam or Istisna
    transaction, i.e., the time when it essentially acquires the control, and hence substantially all risks
    and rewards incidental to ownership, of such subject-matter.
8. Inventory shall initially be recognised at cost. The cost of inventory shall comprise all costs of
    purchase and other costs incurred in bringing the subject-matter to its present location and
    condition. It includes all types of taxes (other than those subsequently recovered), transportation
    and handling costs including related Takaful costs and all other costs directly attributable to bringing
    the subject-matter to its present location and condition including those incurred by the customer in
    the capacity of agent and any fee paid to the agent. Trade discounts, rebates, performance bonus
    and similar items, if any, shall be adjusted with the costs.
9. In case inventory is acquired on a piecemeal basis or in tranches, each tranche of inventory received
    shall be recognised when the conditions defined in paragraph 7 are met.

### Subsequent measurement

#### Advance for Salam goods and advance for Istisna goods

10. Gross amounts of advance for Salam goods and advance for Istisna goods, at the end of a financial
    reporting period, shall be carried at their outstanding amount less any allowance for impairment.
11. Outstanding amounts represent the gross amounts of advance for Salam goods and advance for
    Istisna goods less inventories received or other adjustments including recoveries, discounts, rebates
    and performance bonus, if any.
12. Allowance for impairment, if any, shall be accounted for in accordance with the respective AAOIFI
    FAS^9. A delay in, or inability of the seller to perform delivery of the subject-matter of Salam or Istisna
    transaction shall be considered as an objective evidence of impairment.

(^9) FAS 30 “Impairment, Credit Losses and Onerous Commitments”


#### Inventories

#### Inventories

13. Subsequent to initial recognition, inventories shall be measured at the lower of cost and net
    realisable value.
14. Determination and any adjustment to bring down the value of inventories to net realisable value
    shall be carried out in accordance with the respective AAOIFI FAS^10.
15. A delivery of the subject-matter not matching the contractual specifications may trigger a need for
    reassessment of net realisable value.
16. Any additional handling and holding costs related to inventories shall be charged to statement of
    income during the period in which these arise.

### Derecognition

#### Inventories

17. Inventories shall be derecognised when:

a. the control is transferred to the eventual buyer in form of sale (see paragraph 19 );
b. the control is lost, e.g., in form of physical loss or theft; or
c. these lose their capacity of providing future economic benefits e.g., technological
obsolescence, legal restrictions or if there is no expected buyer.
#### Advance for Salam goods and advance for Istisna goods

18. Advance for Salam goods and advance for Istisna goods shall be derecognised:

a. when the delivery of the intended subject-matter (or a substituted commodity, with mutual
agreement) is complete;
b. when the subject-matter is no more deliverable and advance payments thereagainst are
refunded, with mutual consent;
c. when, due to the seller’s insolvency or other limitations, these (or a substituted commodity
or refund) cannot be recovered; or
d. when the buyer waives its right by writing it off or gifts it as Hiba to the seller.
### Revenue and profit recognition.....................................................................................................................

19. Revenue shall be recognised at gross value at the time of sale of subject-matter to the eventual
    buyer (either directly or through an agent^11 ), which shall coincide with the time of transfer of control
    of inventory (see paragraphs 17(a)). [Explanation 1: The gross revenue shall be the total amount
    billed to the eventual buyer (directly, or through an agent, without any deduction of agency fee or
    incentive payable to the agent). Explanation 2: The buyer shall not recognise any revenue, hence

(^10) FAS 30 “Impairment, Credit Losses and Onerous Commitments”
(^11) An agent, if any, may be appointed in line with the Shari’ah principles and rules to facilitate the sale of the subject-
matter to the eventual buyer. In practice, at times, the seller of the first leg of the transaction is also appointed as an
agent for this purpose.


profit, till the time the subject-matter of Salam or Istisna transaction is not sold to the eventual
buyer.]
20. Agency fee (fixed or variable, including incentive) shall be accounted for separately from (and hence,
    not netted off with) the gross revenue arising on the transaction.

#### Goods purchased under deferred delivery sales contract sold on deferred payment basis

21. In case of subject-matter purchased under a deferred delivery sales contract, which is sold to the
    eventual buyer under a Murabaha or another deferred payment sales contract, the revenue shall be
    recognised in line with the requirements of the respective AAOIFI FAS^12.

### Presentation and disclosures

22. In addition to the disclosure requirements as stated in FAS 1 “General Presentation and Disclosures
    in the Financial Statements”, the following minimum disclosures shall be made in the financial
    statements of the buyer:

a. the accounting policies adopted for deferred delivery sales transactions, including the
aspects of recognition of Salam and Istisna goods (pending delivery), inventory, revenue,
cost of sales and profit (including deferred profit, where applicable), etc.;
b. appropriate disclosures in respect of purchases of subject-matter based on deferred delivery
sales basis:
i. advance for Salam goods (full payment made to the seller);
ii. advance for Istisna goods (full or part payment made to the seller);
iii. commitment in respect of outstanding amount (in case of Istisna transactions)
payable to the seller, if any;
iv. liability in respect of outstanding amount (in case of Istisna transactions) payable to
the seller subsequent to the receipt of subject-matter, if any;
v. impairment, if any, on the advance for Salam goods and advance for Istisna goods
and movement thereon; and
vi. net realisable value adjustment, if any, for inventory;
c. appropriate disclosures in respect of sale of subject-matter based under agency or parallel
deferred delivery sales contracts:
i. amounts receivable against the sale, bifurcating between receivable from the
eventual buyer and the agent;
(^12) See paragraphs 23-28 of FAS 28 “Murabaha and Other Deferred Payment Sales” [Explanation: According to such
requirements, in case of deferred payment sales, the profit arising from the transaction i.e., the difference between
revenue and cost of sales recognised, shall be deferred through a deferred profit account. However, in case where the
equivalent cash sale price of the goods sold is higher than the cost of sales, the profit to the extent of difference
between the cash sale price and the cost of sales shall not be deferred.]


ii. revenue and profit recognised under deferred delivery sales;
iii. credit losses, if any, in respect of amounts receivable from the eventual buyer or
agent (considering the requirements of respective AAOIFI FAS^13 );
iv. unamortised deferred profits against deferred delivery sales receivables,
respectively, providing a movement of the same during the period duly disclosed as
a deduction from the outstanding amount of gross receivables; and
v. onerous commitments / contracts in line with the requirements of respective AAOIFI
FAS^14 ; and
d. the amount waived / written-off, according to their respective nature, during the period.
23. The balance of the advance for Salam goods and advance for Istisna goods and outstanding payables
    shall be presented on the appropriate side of the statement of financial position, without netting off.
24. Where amounts are material, the disclosures mentioned in paragraph 22 may separately identify
    between the Salam and Istisna transactions in the notes to the financial statements, considering the
    different risk factors associated with them, respectively.
25. Where the contract includes a parallel element, such transaction shall be separately disclosed,
    identifying that amount which pertains to the original Salam or Istisna transaction.

## Deferred delivery sales in the books of the seller

### Initial recognition

#### Salam or Istisna goods deliverable

26. Advance cash payments received from the buyer shall be recognised, as follows:

a. in case of a Salam transaction – at the time of entering into a Salam contract as Salam goods
deliverable, equivalent to the amount of cash received; and
b. in case of an Istisna transaction – as and when the advance payment(s) is received (in lump
sum, or in instalments), if any, in line with the contractual arrangements, as Istisna goods
deliverable equivalent to the amount of cash received.
### Subsequent measurement

#### Salam and Istisna goods deliverable

27. Subsequent to initial recognition, liability against Salam and Istisna goods deliverable shall be
    measured at its outstanding amount.

(^13) FAS 30 “Impairment, Credit Losses and Onerous Commitments”
(^14) FAS 30 “Impairment, Credit Losses and Onerous Commitments”


#### Onerous deferred delivery sales contracts................................................................................................

28. Any onerous situation under a deferred delivery sales contract shall be dealt with in line with the
    requirements of the respective AAOIFI FAS^15.

#### Inventories

29. Generally accepted accounting principles^16 shall be applied in respect of accounting and financial
    reporting for the inventory intended to be sold at a later date (irrespective of whether being
    available for intended sale, under growth (as an agricultural produce) or in-process (of
    manufacturing, development, packing, extraction, mining, processing, refining, etc.)).

### Revenue and profit recognition.....................................................................................................................

30. Revenue shall be recognised at gross value at the time of sale of subject-matter to the buyer, which
    shall coincide with the time of transfer of control of inventory (see paragraph 17(a)).
31. In case of such Istisna transaction where full or part of the price is to be received on a deferred basis,
    an appropriate proportion of the profit shall be deferred and recognised over a period of time in line
    with the requirements of respective AAOIFI FAS^17.

### Presentation and disclosures

32. In addition to the disclosure requirements as stated in FAS 1 “General Presentation and Disclosures
    in the Financial Statements”, the following minimum disclosures shall be made in the financial
    statements of the seller:

a. the accounting policies adopted for deferred delivery sales transactions, including the
aspects of recognition of Salam and Istisna goods deliverable, inventory, revenue, cost of
sales and profit (including deferred profit, where applicable), etc.;
b. liabilities against Salam and Istisna goods deliverable;
c. inventories held for deferred delivery distinguishing according to the classification;
d. inventories intended to be held for longer periods with information about the nature and
risks associated thereto;

(^16) Refer paragraph 7 of the AAOIFI Conceptual Framework of Financial Reporting, which states that “Accounting policies
for similar transactions, other events or conditions shall be developed by the institutions according to the following
hierarchy: (a) FAS specifically addressing the respective transaction, other event or condition or other pronouncement
issued by AAOIFI; (b) FAS on similar matters; (c) generally accepted accounting principles as applicable in the respective
jurisdiction, insofar as these are not against the conceptual framework and Shari’ah principles and rules; and (d) the
management's judgment as long as in line with the conceptual framework and the Shari’ah principles and rules.”
(^17) FAS 28 “Murabaha and Other Deferred Payment Sales” [Explanation: According to such requirements, in case of
deferred payment sales, the profit arising from the transaction i.e., the difference between revenue and cost of sales
recognised, shall be deferred through a deferred profit account. However, in case where the equivalent cash sale price
of the goods sold is higher than the cost of sales, the profit to the extent of difference between the cash sale price and
the cost of sales shall not be deferred.]


f. unamortised deferred profits against deferred delivery sales receivables, respectively,
providing a movement of the same during the period duly disclosed as a deduction from the
outstanding amount of gross receivables; and
g. allowance for impairment and credit losses and provision for onerous commitments /

AAOIFI FAS^18.
33. The balance of the receivables and the goods deliverable shall be presented on the appropriate side
    of the statement of financial position, without netting off.

    between the Salam and Istisna transactions in the notes to the financial statements, considering the
    different risk factors associated with them, respectively.
35. Where the contract includes a parallel element, such transaction shall be separately disclosed,
    identifying that amount which pertains to the original Salam or Istisna transaction.

## Related accounting treatments

### Parallel Salam and parallel Istisna

#### Parallel Salam

36. Parallel Salam transactions shall be accounted for separately, as a buyer (see paragraphs 6 - 25 ) and a
    seller (see paragraphs 26 - 35) on a mutually exclusive basis.

#### Parallel Istisna

37. Parallel Istisna transactions that fall within the scope of this standard (see paragraph 2 - 4 ) shall be
    accounted for separately, as a buyer (see paragraphs 6 - 25 ) and a seller (see paragraphs 26 - 35 ) on a
    mutually exclusive basis.

### Subsequent change of price of the subject-matter

#### Subsequent change in the price or the subject-matter with mutual consent

38. Any subsequent change in the price or the subject-matter of a Salam or Istisna transaction, with
    mutual consent, shall be considered as an event taking place at the time of such agreement of
    change, and shall not give rise to a gain or loss at that time. The eventual profit or loss, and change
    therein, shall be recognised only once the sale to the eventual buyer is made. However, such a
    change event may be considered as an objective evidence of impairment or necessary adjustment
    for net realisable value.

#### Change in price of the subject-matter of Istisna contract based on performance

39. A change in price of the subject-matter of an Istisna contract based on performance (meeting the
    delivery target, or delaying from the initially agreed delivery date), according to the pre-agreed

(^18) FAS 30 “Impairment, Credit Losses and Onerous Commitments”


mechanism defined under the contract, in line with Shari’ah principles and rules^19 , shall be
accounted for in line with the requirements of paragraph 38.
## Effective date

40. This standard shall be effective on the financial statements of institutions for financial periods
    beginning on or after 1 January 2027. Early adoption of the standard is encouraged.

## Amendments to other standards

41. This standard, along with the [ED of] FAS __ “Istisna-based Development Contracts”, supersedes the
    earlier FAS 7 “Salam and Parallel Salam” and FAS 10 “Istisna’a and Parallel Istisna’a”.
