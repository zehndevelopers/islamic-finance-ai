# UNDERSTANDING IN QARD HASSAN

## Introduction

Definition of Qardhul Hassan can be easily found in many text books. For example Ayub (2007, 492): says: “Qardh literally “to cut”. It is so called because the property is cut off – transferred to the borrower.”

***Literal meaning*** The Qardhul Hassan consists of two words: (1) al-Qardh, and (2) al-Hassan. Al-Qardh is associated with the word „qirad‟ means to cut. It is said so, because by applying the Qardh it means that there will be a cut some of the lender’s property by providing the loan to the borrower. While „Hassan‟ means a kindness. In other words, the practice of „Hassan‟ is understood as an act that benefits other persons.

Qardhul Hassan can be divine an interest-free loan in the Islamic religion, or zero-return loan that Al-*Quran* urges Muslims to Make available to the needy. In other words, the borrower only needs to pay back the principal amount without any obligation for an additional amount. However, the borrower is encouraged and may pay an additional or extra amount at his/her absolute discretion as a token of appreciation, so long as it is not stated in the contract between the two parties. In addition, Qardhul Hassanis an example of a unique instrument offered by Islamic Financial Institutions (“IFIs”) as compared to their counterparts, the conventional financial institution. Moreover *Qardhul Hassan* is an effective means of economic development and Poverty alleviation. Some Muslim scholars named Qardhul Hassan Islamic Alternative of the interest**.**

It is interesting to observe that the Qardhul Hassan has been so far seriously neglected by many Islamic banks. Although it is always discussed to be one of product or services the Islamic Banks can offer, but few – as later confirmed by this study– have implemented this particular product. This is among the important reasons why so many studies were conducted.

Qardhul Hassan is one of main things based on charity Zakat and waqaf concerning the redistribution of income and wealth and, therefore, is needed for the welfare of the society. The prohibition of *Riba* is very significant and is always brought into any discussion of Islamic Finance contracts. As such, generally, Qardhul Hassanis urged in Islam not just because of its uniqueness and flexibility but also because of prohibition and therefore no involvement of riba, this shows the spirit of cooperation (*ta’awun*) and brotherhood (*ukhuwah*), which will improve the welfare of society as a whole.

The key objective of Islamic (*Qardhul Hassan*) is to help those who facing financial difficulties in order to protect them from getting involved with interest (*riba)* based loan which is prohibited in Islam

From the view of the fact that the importance of helping the poor and the needy has been emphasized and strongly encouraged in the Islamic faith, Qardhul Hassan scheme plays an important role in providing financial support for those people without being involved in the element of ribawhich is deliberated as a declaration of a war with Almighty Allah (s.w.t) and His messenger. Accordingly Allah (S.W.T) mentioned in the Holy Qur’an the following verses:

**تفعلوا لم فان )“278”(مؤمنين كنتم ان الربوا من بقي ما وذروا الله اتقوا امنوا الذين ياايها)**

**‘2“279”(تظلمون ولا تظلمون لا موالكم رؤوس فلكم تبتم وان ورسوله الله من بحرب فأذنوا**

“O you, who have believed, fear Allah and give up what remains [due to you] of interest, if you should be believers (278). And if you do not, then be informed of a war [against you] from Allah and His Messenger. But if you repent, you may have your principal [thus] you do no wrong, nor are you wronged (2:279).

### Legality of Qardhul Hassan

The legitimacy of Qardhul Hassan is found in the Holy Qur’an as well as in the Sunnah of Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him.

From the Qur‟an Allah (s.w.t) said in the *taqabun ayah (64:17)*,

**((حليم شكور والله لكم ويغفر لكم يضاعفه حسنا قرضا الله تقرضوا إن)): تعالى قوله**

**Allah say** *((If you loan Allah a goodly loan, He will multiply it for you and forgive you. And Allah is Most Appreciative and Forbearing.))*

On the other side there is evidence from the (Sunnah) of our prophet peace be upon him

| حَدَّثَنَا عَمْرُو بْنُ عَلِيٍّ، قَالَ حَدَّثَنَا عَبْدُ الرَّحْمَنِ، عَنْ سُفْيَانَ، عَنْ إِسْمَاعِيلَ بْنِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ بْنِ عَبْدِ اللَّهِ بْنِ أَبِي رَبِيعَةَ، عَنْ أَبِيهِ، عَنْ جَدِّهِ، قَالَ اسْتَقْرَضَ مِنِّي النَّبِيُّ صلى الله عليه وسلم أَرْبَعِينَ أَلْفًا فَجَاءَهُ مَالٌ فَدَفَعَهُ إِلَىَّ وَقَالَ ‏ "‏ بَارَكَ اللَّهُ لَكَ فِي أَهْلِكَ وَمَالِكَ إِنَّمَا جَزَاءُ السَّلَفِ الْحَمْدُ وَالأَدَاءُ ‏"‏ ‏.‏ |

it was narrated from Isla'il bin Ibrahim bin 'Abdullah bin Abi Rabi'ah, from his father, that his grandfather said: "The **Prophet**borrowed forty thousand from me, then some wealth came to him, and he paid me back and said: 'May Allah bless your family and your wealth for you: the reward for lending is praise and repayment."

The above evidences from Al-Qur’an and Sunnah are the legality of Qardhul Hassan, This loan is been approved by the Islamic scholars *(Ulama)* which is deemed to be Consensus *(Ijma)* of the nation on the lawfulness of Islamic Qardhul Hassan loan.

## Literature review

### Qard Hasan in the Qur’an

Qard Hasan in the Qur’an The term qard hasan occurs in six places in the Qur‘an. They are reproduced below.

Who is it that would loan to God qard hasan so He may double (multiply) it for him many times over? And it is Allah who withholds and grants abundance, and to Him you will be returned. [al-Baqara 2/245]

And God had already taken a covenant from the Children of Israel, and we delegated from among them twelve leaders. And God said, "I am with you. If you establish prayer and give zakah and believe in my messengers and support them and loan to God qard hasan, I will surely remove from you your misdeeds and admit you to gardens beneath which rivers flow. But whoever of you disbelieves after that has certainly strayed from the soundness of the way. [al-Ma‘ida 5/12]

Who is it that would loan to God qard hasan so He will double (multiply) it for him and he will have a noble reward? [al-Hadid 57/11]

Indeed, the men who practice charity and the women who practice charity and [they who] have loaned to God qard hasan - it will be doubled (multiplied) for them, and they will have a noble reward. [al-Hadid 57/18]

If you loan to God qard hasan, He will double (multiply) it for you and forgive you. And Allah is Most Appreciative and Forbearing. [al-Taghabun 64/17]

… So recite what is easy from it and establish prayer and give zakah and loan to God qard hasan. And whatever good you put forward for yourselves - you will find it with Allah. It is better and greater in reward. And seek forgiveness of Allah. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful. [al-Muzzammil 73/20]

In trying to understand the Qur‘anic perspective, let‘s first note a few pertinent points.

A. There is no Qur‘anic verse that refers to qard without qualifying it as qard hasan. The word qard appears in six places in the Qur‘an: 2:245, 5:12, 57:11, 57:18, 64:17, 73:20 as quoted above. At each place, without exception, it is not just qard, but qard hasan.

B. This qard is not to any human being, but to God. In each of these verses, invariably, God is the borrower and the believer is the lender, and furthermore, God is seeking (not that he really needs) and urging that the believers offer qard hasan to him. Not a single time this activity or transaction has been presented as human to human transaction in a commercial sense.

C. While the traditional concept of qard hasan is that it is a return-free loan as far as the lender is concerned, the Qur‘an contradicts that notion by presenting this transaction with extraordinary return or benefit (doubled or multiplied) to the lender. It can be argued that here the lender is not asking or stipulating the return, but rather the borrower is voluntarily giving. However, if we try to understand this verse in human terms, just like if a borrower states that he will provide a return (doubled or multiplied) and the lender lends on the basis of that understanding, the return essentially becomes binding in the form of a promise. As in case of these verses in the Qur‘an, the borrower is none other than God himself, and any offer of return from him can‘t be considered anything less than assured. Allah affirms: ―

… And who is truer to his covenant than God? [at-Tauba 9/111] It can be further argued that when the Qur‘an mentions about return or benefit to the lender, it is not worldly return, but it is in the life hereafter from God. Indeed, that should be the case, and from that angle it should not be then part of any human to human commercial transaction.

### Qard Hasan in the Sunnah

The sunnah of the Prophet (s.a.s) is also very clear on this issue. It is reported that the Prophet (saw) said, "in the night of the journey, I saw on the gate of heaven written, 'reward for sadakah is ten times and reward for qard al-hasan is eighteen times'. So, I asked the angel, how is it possible? The angel replied, "Because beggar who asked had already had something but a loanee did not ask for loan unless he was in need." [Ibn Hisham & Ibn Majah].

In another hadith reported by Abu Hurairah (R), the Prophet (s.a.s) said, "whoever relieves a believer from a difficulty in this world, Allah will relieve him from his difficulty and Allah will facilitate him in this world and world hereafter." [Muslim]

Abu Hurayrah said, the prophet of Allah [pbuh] said, “On the Day of Judgment, Allah will say: O son of Adam, I was sick yet you did not visit me. He will reply, O Allah, how could I have visited you since you are Lord of the Worlds? Allah will say: Did you not know that so-and-so a servant of mine was sick, and yet you did not visit him? Did you not realize that if you had visited him [I would be aware of this, and would reward you] and you would have found me with him? O son of Adam, I asked for food from you but you did not feed me. He will say: My Lord how could I feed you since You are the Lord of the Worlds? Allah shall say: didn’t you know that so-and-so a servant of Mine asked food from you but you did not feed him, did you not realize that had fed him you would certainly have found [its reward] with Me? O son of Adam, I asked water from you but you did not provide Me with water. He will say, O Allah, how could I have provided you [with water] when You are Lord of the Worlds. Allah will say: so-and-so a servant of Mine asked you for water to drink but you did not provide him with water. Did you not realize that had you pr Surah ovided him with water to drink you would have found [its reward] with me?” [Sahih Muslim].

The above Qur'anic verses and ahadith directly and indirectly encourage the Muslims to give qard al-hasan and which will increase their credits in manifold and bring forgiveness for them.

### Muslim Scholars point view of Al-Qardhul Hassan

Defining the *qard*, jurists from all major *sunni* schools of jurisprudence agree on its essential features with slight differences in the related details, and there are two point view of the four Muslim madhabis, Imam abu-hanifah is one side alone while the three rest of the scholars having same idea but different from Imam abu-hanifah

* According to *hanafi* a *qard* is a legal contract of transferring the ownership of a fungible property to the borrower, in which the lender delivers the object with the condition of receiving its equivalent in the later point of time (Al-Jazayri, 2000).
* On the other side for the three schools, the scope of *qard* is not confined within the ambit of fungible property only, but, along with fungible properties, all tradable goods and animals are also covered under the definition of *qard* (Zuhayli, 2003).

### Pillars of Al-Qardh Al- Hassan

* Muqridh *(creditor or lender)*

* Muqtaridh *(debtor or borrower)*

* Maal *(property)*

* Sighah *(ijab/over and qabul/acceptance)*

### Conditions of *Al-Qardh Al-Hassan*

Al-qardh Al-hassan, being a contract (*aqd*) between two parties requires the same principles that apply for other Islamic transactions, which are as follows

1. Both parties should be legally capable to enter into the *qardh* contract

To enter into a contract, parties must be *baligh, aqil* and *rashid*(major with sound mind). The Quran (Surah Al Nisa 4:6) states:

“Prove orphans till they reach the marriageable age; then, if ye find them of sound judgment, deliver over unto them their fortune; and devour it not by squandering and in haste lest they should grow up Whoso (of the guardians) is rich, let him abstain generously (from taking of the property of orphans); and whoso is poor let him take thereof in reason (for his guardianship). And when ye deliver up their fortune unto orphans, have (the transaction) witnessed in their presence. Allah sufficeth as a Reckoner.”

This verse specifies that the age of marriage and the sound judgment is the age of majority, which means that a major person is capable to enter into any transaction validly.

1. *Ijab* (offer) and *qabul* (acceptance) of the *qardh* must be clearly made before entering into the loan contract

In the loan agreement, there should be clear expression, collation and conjunction of the *ijab* and *qabul* between the parties so as to prevent dispute in future.

1. The date of payment must be specified

The date of payment of the loan should be mentioned in the loan agreement. If no such date is specified, the transaction may lead to ambiguity and dispute among the lender and the borrower.

When Prophet (s.a.w) migrated to Madinah, he was informed that contracts of *salam* were made without specifying the amount or date, in which he says, “Whoever enters into a contract of salam should specify the date of delivery and the amount of the subject matter.”

1. The contract should be in writing

Allah s.w.t says in Surah Al Baqarah (2:282)

“O ye who believe! When you contract a debt for a fixed term, record it in writing. Let a scribe record it in writing between you in (terms of) equity.”

### Types of Al-Qardh

With the evolution of Islamic banking and finance as a distinct discipline of research, most forms of classical Islamic transactional modes have attracted fresh scholarly interest. In this context, due to being *shariah*-compliant deposit and financial instrument, the concept of *qardh* has also witnessed some lively discussions. However, in most of the recent works, *qardh* has been divided into two categories, namely:

Qardh Hassan(*loan par excellence)* and Qardh ribawi(*interest bearing loan*). For example, Farooq (2011, p. 1) points out: From the traditional viewpoint Qardh or loan is Ribawi, meaning that Qardh is subject to the prohibition of Riba. Therefore, the only valid Qardh would be Qardh Al-Hassan that does not accompany any stipulated benefit to the lender.

### Objectives of Al-Qardh Al-Hassan

Islam emphasizes on brotherhood among the Muslims and since al-qardh Al-hassan being a gratuitous loan can help the fellow Muslims who need money, we can deduce the objectives of al-qardh Al Hassan as the following:

* To help the needy fellow people
* To establish better relationship among the poor and the rich people
* To mobilize wealth among people in the society
* To perform a good deed that is encouraged and appreciated by Allah s.w.t. and Prophet Muhammad s.a.w.
* To strengthen the national economy
* To facilitate the poor to create new job market and business venture by using their merits, skills and expertise
* To establish a caring society
* To eradicate unemployment problem from the society
* To remove social and economic discrimination in the society

## DICUSSION

### The difference between Islamic loan and conventional loan

In order to explain the differences between the Islamic and conventional loan, first the general concept of loan needs to be addressed, from both conventional and Islamic prospective in terms of banking.  From the conventional point of view loan is a type of debt which involves two parties’ lender and borrower.  In a loan the borrower receives a certain amount of money from the lender which here is the bank; this borrowed money is called the principal amount, which needs to be paid back by the borrower at a later period through instalment and these terms are enforced by legal contract.  Now the bank requires the borrower to pay back the principal at a cost which is the interest that is the incentive for lender (bank) to engage in providing loan. Similarly Islamic loan (qard) are also form of debt where there is transfer of ownership of fungible wealth (loans in terms of Islamic banking does not necessarily be money it can be any tangible asset) to a person on whom it is binding to return wealth similar to it.

From the above we can say that both Islamic and Convention loans are form of debt.  So what really is the difference here? The prime difference lies in the incentive aspect. Interest is the dominated aspect of Conventional loans which is excess amount paid over the principal. In contrast Islamic banks cannot charge excess over the principal as interest constitutes riba which is prohibited in Shariah (Islamic Law).  “Allah permitted al-bay (trading) and prohibited riba  (Al-Baqarah: 225); Quran refused to accept the contract of interest-bearing loan as fair business trade. Hence loan for Islamic banks has no monetary gain in comparison to conventional banking where loan is their prime profit generating tool.

Taking profit from interest-bearing loan is unjust from an Islamic prospective therefore loan is not a profit generating tool in Islamic banking. However it is permitted for banks to charge for services rendered, that is the operational cost involved in issuance of the loan any excess amount is prohibited. Therefore it is mandatory for the loan contract to clearly state the operational cost of the service.  Islamic Banks do issue Qard Hassan (benevolent loan) to fulfil part of its social responsibility; it’s given to employees of the banks or to students in many cases.

 From here we can conclude that loan is not a mechanism for generating profit for Islamic banks compared to conventional banks. Trade contracts (al-bay) are used to earn profit they involve buying and selling of assets.

### Islamic Banking Practices Regarding Qardhul Hassan

While qardh Hassanis for the needy, one should not presume any needy person can approach an Islamic bank seeking qardh Hassan. The practices vary widely among banks.

Sudin Haron describes the wide variations across Muslim-majority countries of the model of their respective deposit structure. “There is no standardised Shariah principle used by all Islamic banks in delivering deposit facilities.”

One may wonder why so much variation and when all these are presented as

Shariah-compliant, what is the *dalil* from the primary sources in Islam about such matters. Only when such questions are raised, one notices the paucity of concrete or solid grounding of these matters in the foundational sources of Islam. Contrary to the claim that IFIs are distinctively based on Islam, as Haron acknowledges: “In most cases, the operational aspects and practices of these deposit facilities are similar to practices of conventional bank deposit facilities”.

Banking practice also varies whether *qar*dh h*assan* type loans are treated as payable on demand or payable as feasible by the borrower. Also, some banks require recovery of administrative cost of *qar*dh h*assan* through service charge, while others do not.

Some banks, as in Iran, categorize all deposits, demand and savings, as *qar*dh h*assan*, while others treat only demand deposit as *qardh hassan*.
