## Preface

PR1 Auditing for Islamic financial institutions, Islamic finance transactions and other financial and related
information having compliance with Shari’ah principles and rules and the AAOIFI’s Financial
Accounting Standards, in particular, have been a part of the AAOIFI’s standard setting mandate since
its inception. The approach was to develop a limited set of standards focusing only on the value
addition and the specific aspects of auditing related to Shari’ah principles and rules and the specific
business models and structures related to Islamic finance, while allowing use of other established
practices of auditing (in particular, International Standards on Auditing (ISAs), issued by the
International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB)).

PR2 Considering significant developments in the auditing profession in last several years, an auditing
standards revision project was initiated by the AAOIFI Governance and Ethics Board to align the
AAOIFI’s auditing standards (now named as “AAOIFI Standards on Auditing and Assurance” (SOAAs)¹ )
with the current established practices of auditing, and the updated AAOIFI strategy for auditing
standards setting.

PR3 It is expected that this project shall include the following work products:

a. a standard on the framework of auditing² ;

b. a standard, on special considerations of an audit, particularly on the aspects of compliance
with Shari’ah principles and rules (this standard);

c. a guidance note, on the illustrative auditor’s report; and

d. guidance note(s) on the audit of Islamic finance products, services, structures and business models.

PR4 This standard shall be read in conjunction with [ED of] SOAA 1 "Framework of Auditing" and
supersedes the existing SOAA 4 “Testing for Compliance with Shari’ah Rules and Principles by an
External Auditor”.

¹ Previously issued as AAOIFI Auditing Standards for Islamic Financial Institutions (ASIFI), later renamed as AAOIFI Standards on Auditing and Assurance (SOAA).

## Introduction

### Overview

{{ ... }}
IN4 AAOIFI SOAAs, including this SOAA, are developed in line with the revised AAOIFI auditing standard
setting strategy, considering the aspects that need to be considered by the auditors of financial
statements for IFIs and entities that report in line, and comply, with Shari’ah principles and rules.
These aspects, inter-alia, include:

a. the information needs of Shari'ah conscious stakeholders⁴ as to whether the transactions
conducted by the institution are Shari’ah compliant. This is based on the premise that such
users of the financial statements are not merely interested in profit, rather they are equally
concerned whether Shari’ah principles and rules have been complied with while earning
such profit; and

{{ ... }}
b. the business model and transaction structures in case of various Islamic financial institutions
and Islamic finance structures, as well as, other Shari’ah compliant institutions e.g., social
financial institutions, which are different from their conventional counterparts, and hence
are subject to specific financial reporting requirements.

IN5 The new strategy is to develop a limited set of standards while complementing, instead of
competing with, other established practices of auditing (in particular, International Standards on
Auditing (ISAs), issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB)). This
entails providing value addition through addressing specific aspects of auditing related to Shari’ah
principles and rules and the specific business models and structures related to Islamic finance, which
are not the subject of other established practices of auditing.

IN6 Development of an updated set of standards on auditing was considered essential by the AAOIFI
Governance and Ethics Board, considering the recent developments in the established practices of
auditing and the increasing need for guidance in this area. Hence, a comprehensive project of
revision of auditing standards was initiated, resulting in the work products including this standard.

³ Shari'ah conscious stakeholder is a stakeholder who has an interest in the institution to be informed whether the institution is following Shari'ah principles and rules while conducting its business.

This standard was considered essential in order to provide the necessary guidance to an auditor for
specific considerations related to compliance with Shari’ah principles and rules.

### Significant changes from the previous standard

IN7 This standard brings significant changes from its predecessor standard (SOAA 4 “Testing for
Compliance with Shari’ah Rules and Principles by an External Auditor”), inter-alia, in the following
aspects:

a. the contents and requirements have been aligned with the revised [ED of] SOAA 1
“Framework of Auditing” and other work product(s) of the recent auditing standards
revision project;

b. definitions and significant principles have been aligned with current established practices of
auditing (EPAs), including coverage of certain aspects which were not covered in the
predecessor standard(s), including aspects related to reporting, communication, related
parties, compliance with Shari’ah principles and rules, etc.;

c. the auditor’s responsibility with regard to considerations for Shari’ah principles and rules
has been addressed in detail, bifurcating between the truth and fairness opinion and the
Shari’ah compliance opinion, and the same have further been aligned with the EPAs;

d. the auditor’s responsibilities with regard to consideration of the design and effective
implementation of Shari’ah principles and rules, respectively, have been clarified; and

e. additional guidance in respect of substantive procedures, as well as, reporting,
communication and documentation requirements has been provided.

## Objective of the standard

1. The objective of this standard is to prescribe the auditing requirements applicable to an auditor in
   respect of the consideration for Shari’ah principles and rules in an audit of financial statements of an
   Islamic financial institution (IFI / the institution) or another institution that operates in compliance,
   and reports in line, with Shari’ah principles and rules.

## Scope

2. This standard prescribes an auditor’s responsibility to consider Shari’ah principles and rules in an
   audit of financial statements of an IFI or another institution^4 that operates in compliance, and
   reports in line, with Shari’ah principles and rules, carried out in accordance with the AAOIFI auditing
   framework^5. This standard compliments the requirements of AAOIFI Standard on Auditing and
   Assurance (SOAA) 1 “Framework of Auditing” and shall be read in conjunction therewith.
3. An audit of the following is not considered within the scope of this standard:

a. an external Shari’ah audit (independent assurance engagement with regard to an
institution’s compliance with Shari’ah principles and rules), where the assurance service
provider is engaged specifically to provide an opinion with regard to the institution’s
compliance with Shari’ah principles and rules;

b. an assurance engagement with a limited or specific scope where the assurance service
provider is engaged specifically to provide an opinion with regard to such limited or specific
scope, e.g., a certification of computation and distribution of profits and losses attributable
to respective stakeholders;

c. a transaction or structure, offered by a conventional financial institution referred to in
clauses (a) and (b) of paragraph 3 of AAOIFI Financial Accounting Standard (FAS) 40
“Financial Reporting for Islamic Finance Windows”; and

d. an institution engaged in general business operations which are not in compliance with an
identified set of Shari’ah principles and rules, as well as, an identified Shari’ah governance
framework.

(^4) Explanation: AAOIFI SOAAs are meant for providing a framework for the audit of financial statements of IFIs. However, these may also be applied for the purpose of audit of financial statements of institutions (including virtual institutions) other than IFIs including, in particular, the social finance institutions and institutions involving Islamic finance structures and transactions.

## Auditor's responsibility with regard to considerations for Shari'ah principles and rules in an audit of financial statements

5. The overall aim of an audit of financial statements, the overall objectives of an auditor and the
   auditor’s responsibilities in connection therewith are established in accordance with the
   requirements of the respective AAOIFI SOAA²². According to the same, the auditor's opinion is
   comprised of the following:

a. truth and fairness opinion – on the truth and fairness of the financial statements of the
institution, in all material respects, in line with the applicable financial reporting framework;
and

b. Shari’ah compliance opinion – as to whether (or not) the institution has complied, in all
material respects, with the Shari’ah principles and rules applicable to its financial
arrangements, contracts and transactions during the period covered by the financial
statements.

#### Broad classification of Shari’ah principles and rules requiring auditor’s consideration

6. The Shari’ah principles and rules that require auditor’s consideration during an audit of financial
   statements of an institution may be broadly categorised as follows:

a. Shari’ah principles and rules that affect the auditor’s truth and fairness opinion, including:

i. Shari’ah principles and rules relevant to accounting and financial reporting
requirements (see paragraph 8 ); and

ii. Shari’ah principles and rules whose non-compliance may have financial impact (see
paragraph 9 ); and

b. other Shari’ah principles and rules that may not affect the auditor’s truth and fairness
opinion.

[Explanation: With regard to the auditor’s Shari’ah compliance opinion, all of the above categories
may have relevance.]

#### Auditor’s responsibility with regard to the truth and fairness opinion

7. For the purpose of providing an opinion on truth and fairness of the financial statements of an
   institution, an auditor shall have due consideration of the institution’s compliance with Shari’ah
   principles and rules, that may impact treatment, presentation and disclosure in the financial
   statements.
8. There can be certain Shari’ah principles and rules that may require specific accounting and financial
   reporting treatments, presentation and disclosures in an institution’s financial statements. These
   may include, e.g.:

²² [ED of] SOAA 1 "Framework of Auditing"

a. certain accounting and financial reporting treatments in the financial statements, including
establishment of contractual rights and obligations of the counter-parties and hence,
requiring application of an appropriate financial reporting framework²³; and

b. appropriate presentation and disclosures in the financial statements regarding the nature,
contractual rights and obligations and other relevant aspects about certain transactions and
balances.

9. Additionally, the financial statements may be affected, inter-alia, by the following situations of non-
   compliance with Shari’ah principles and rules:

a. financial effect of such non-compliance resulting, e.g., in the reversal of the transaction,
changes in the rights and obligations of the counter-parties and stakeholders and payments
due to charity / purification of income;

b. non-compliance of contractual arrangements with counter-parties resulting in financial
effects, e.g., in changes in rights and obligations, recognition of revenue and expenses,
computation of profits (and losses) and their respective attribution to different
stakeholders; and

c. legal and regulatory non-compliance situation and expectation of resulting punitive actions
by the regulatory and supervisory authorities (RSAs) including, e.g., restrictions on business
activities or financial penalties.

10. The requirements in this standard regarding the auditor’s responsibility for the truth and fairness
    opinion are designed to assist the auditor in identifying any material misstatement of the financial
    statements due to non-compliance with Shari’ah principles and rules, considering, inter-alia, the
    factors enumerated in paragraphs 8 - 9. Accordingly, the auditor is responsible for obtaining
    reasonable assurance that the financial statements, taken as a whole, are free from material
    misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In conducting an audit of financial statements, the
    auditor shall consider the effect of the applicable Shari’ah principles and rules (see paragraphs 21 -
    23 ), as relevant to respective stages and process flow of an audit engagement.
11. An auditor shall consider the requirements (including certain detailed procedures and reporting
    requirements) of EPAs, regarding the audit considerations for compliance with laws and regulations,
    as considered relevant and suitable in the context of application of the requirements of this
    standard.

#### Auditor’s responsibility with regard to the Shari’ah compliance opinion

12. There is a rebuttable presumption that the auditor’s responsibility regarding the work to be
    performed enabling it to form its Shari’ah compliance opinion concluding as to whether (or not) the
    institution has complied with the Shari’ah principles and rules, shall ordinarily not enhance its overall
    responsibility, and hence the work to be performed, regarding its primary responsibility.

²³ For example, certain Shari'ah principles and rules (see paragraph 5 v(v)) are established considering the accounting and financial reporting requirements. (Also see Chapter 1 of AAOIFI Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting (Revised 2020)).

13. The presumption stipulated in paragraph 12 may be rebutted and an auditor’s responsibility
    regarding the Shari’ah compliance opinion may increase, and hence appropriate additional work
    may be necessitated, if its assessment of risk related to the inability of detection of the institution’s
    non-compliance with Shari’ah principles and rules is increased by virtue of any, or a combination, of
    the following factors:

a. absence or inadequacy of the Shari’ah governance framework;

b. weak Shari’ah compliance risk management function;

c. inadequate internal controls relevant to Shari’ah compliance; and / or

d. auditor’s inability to place reliance on (or an absence of):

i. the work performed by the SSB and the SSB’s report;

ii. the work performed by the external Shari’ah auditor and the external Shari’ah
auditor’s report; and

iii. the work performed by the internal Shari'ah audit function and its respective
reports.

#### Auditor's respective responsibilities with regard to design and effective implementation of Shari'ah principles and rules

14. The auditor’s responsibility with regard to forming the Shari’ah compliance opinion, according to the
    hierarchy prescribed in the definition of Shari’ah principles and rules, along with the respective
    explanation, shall be established as follows:

a. regarding the design part of the financial arrangements, contracts and transactions, i.e.,
Shari’ah compliance in respect of product structures, documentation and process flows, the
auditor’s responsibility is limited to the extent of ensuring compliance with such
requirements contained in the respective hierarchy (while ensuring the appropriate order of
priority), without forming his own opinion in respect of such matters, and referring to the
institution’s SSB / Shari’ah supervisor for any relevant interpretation; and

b. regarding the effective implementation of Shari’ah principles and rules in financial
arrangements, contracts and transactions during the period, the auditor would generally be
responsible for ensuring compliance in line with the requirements of the AAOIFI auditing
framework, particularly, those contained in this standard.

#### Limitations of auditor's responsibility in the context of assessment of compliance with Shari'ah principles and rules in the audit of financial statements

15. Owing to the inherent limitations of an audit, the auditor cannot be expected to detect all instances
    of non-compliance with Shari’ah principles and rules. There is an unavoidable risk that some
    material misstatements in the financial statements may not be detected, even though the audit is
    properly planned and performed in accordance with the AAOIFI auditing framework²⁴.

²⁴ See paragraph 4 of [ED of] SOAA 1 "Framework of Auditing"”

16. In the context of Shari’ah principles and rules, the potential effects of inherent limitations on the
    auditor’s ability to detect material misstatements are greater for the following reasons:

a. there are Shari’ah principles and rules, relating principally to the operating aspects of an
institution, that typically do not affect the financial statements and are not captured by the
institution’s information systems relevant to financial reporting; or

b. non-compliance may involve conduct designed to conceal it, such as collusion, forgery,
deliberate failure to record transactions, management override of controls or intentional
misrepresentations made to the auditor.

17. In most circumstances, there is a rebuttable presumption that any non-compliance with Shari’ah
    principles and rules is less likely to be detected by the auditor, and hence the auditor may not be
    considered responsible for detecting the same, if:

a. it is not directly affecting the events, transactions and balances reflected in the financial
statements; or

b. it is not material from a quantitative perspective for the purpose of preparing financial
statements, despite being material from a qualitative perspective regarding compliance with
Shari’ah principles and rules.

18. The determination of any relief in the auditor’s responsibility in line with the provisions of
    paragraphs 15 and 17 , shall be carefully established subject to the requirements of paragraphs 12 -
    13 , regarding the necessity of enhancement in the work to be performed and fulfilment of all
    relevant requirements of this standard.

#### Management’s and TCWG’s responsibility................................................................................................

19. It is the responsibility of management, with the oversight of TCWG, to ensure the institution’s
    compliance with Shari’ah principles and rules applicable to its financial arrangements, contracts and
    transactions and for establishing the internal controls considered necessary for this purpose^25.

## Compliance requirements

### Quality management

20. An auditor shall ensure that it has adequate capability in terms of resources and knowledge of the
    Shari’ah principles and rules and the nature of operations and transactions of the institution in order
    to fulfil the responsibilities under the engagement in a professional manner, in accordance with the
    requirements of respective AAOIFI SOAA^26.

(^25) See paragraphs 138-139 of [ED of] SOAA 1 “Framework of Auditing”
(^26) Also see paragraphs 12 - 14 and 3 6 - 37

## Conduct of an audit

### Planning and risk assessment

#### Determination of applicable Shari’ah principles and rules and their implementation requirements

21. An auditor shall develop an understanding of the applicable Shari’ah principles and rules, with
    appropriate hierarchy of the same in line with the requirements of relevant AAOIFI standards, and
    the legal and regulatory framework, industry practices and contractual requirements (including
    those applicable according to the constitution documents of the institution). The auditor shall also
    develop understanding of the respective process flows, approved standard documentation and
    product manuals / SOPs.

#### Assessing the suitability of the applicable Shari’ah principles and rules

22. An auditor shall assess the suitability of applicable Shari’ah principles and rules regarding the
    respective institution and shall document the detailed requirements thereof. For the institution’s
    respective functions and products, whereby appropriate Shari’ah principles and rules are not
    available, the auditor shall interact with the Shari’ah supervisor(s) / SSB of the institution and obtain
    specific rulings (and other relevant guidance) accordingly.
23. In cases where the auditor is unable to conclude with regard to the suitability of applicable Shari’ah
    principles and rules, he shall either:

a. withdraw from the engagement altogether – if the impact on the truth and fairness opinion
is considered pervasive; or

b. disclaim the Shari’ah compliance opinion – if the impact on the truth and fairness opinion is
not considered pervasive.

#### Interaction with Shari’ah supervisor(s)

24. The auditor may need to interact with, communicate with, request Fatawa, rulings or specific
    opinions from the Shari’ah supervisor(s) / SSB of the institution, or their nominee, including on their
    observations.

#### Identifying and assessing the risk of non-compliance with Shari’ah principles and rules

25. An auditor’s overall responsibility regarding its Shari’ah compliance opinion, and hence, the work
    that needs to be performed may be enhanced by the probable impact of the significant factors
    enumerated in paragraph 12. Accordingly, the planning and risk assessment phase of an audit shall
    include considerations regarding the same. Similarly, the requirements of paragraphs 26 - 39 may
    result in changes in the overall planning and risk assessment and the extent of work to be performed
    by the auditor.

(^27) Paragraphs 17 and 18 of SOAA 6 “External Shari’ah Audit (Independent Assurance Engagement on an IFI’s Compliance
with Shari’ah principles and rules)”
(^28) Paragraph 12 of SOAA 6 “External Shari’ah Audit (Independent Assurance Engagement on an IFI’s Compliance with
Shari’ah principles and rules)”

26. In addition, an auditor shall, using his knowledge, analysis and experience, identify relevant risks of
    non-compliance with Shari’ah principles and rules by obtaining an understanding of issues arising in
    past years, as well as, changes that have occurred in the industry that may have given rise to risks
    previously unidentified. An auditor shall also consider the significant changes in the Shari’ah
    governance and control environment. Moreover, the effect, if any, of the changes in Shari’ah
    principles and rules (e.g., by way of adoption of a new standard or regulation or application of a new
    Fatwa or ruling) on the existing products and services shall also be considered.
27. An auditor shall determine the impact of the findings on the current risk assessment and, after
    evaluating the relevant mitigating factors, including the effectiveness of Shari’ah governance and
    control environment, shall apply his professional judgment, so as to conclude on whether enhanced
    audit procedures are necessary to bring such risk to an acceptable level.

#### principles and rules.................................................................................................................................... Assessment of governance and control environment mitigating the risk of non-compliance with Shari’ah

#### with Shari’ah principles and rules

28. As part of obtaining an understanding of an institution and its Shari’ah governance and internal
    control environment relevant to the implementation of Shari’ah principles and rules, an auditor shall
    obtain a general understanding of:

a. the Shari’ah principles and rules applicable to the institution and the extent to which
Shari’ah principles and rules form part of the hierarchy of such legal and regulatory
framework (see paragraphs 21 - 23 ); and

b. as to how the institution is complying with that framework and relevant controls.

29. An auditor shall obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding compliance with the
    provisions of those Shari’ah principles and rules generally recognised to have a direct effect on the
    determination of material amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.

#### Determining audit materiality

30. An auditor shall consider the significance of compliance with Shari’ah principles and rules on the
    quantitative and qualitative aspects of determination of audit materiality in line with the
    requirements of the respective AAOIFI SOAA^29 , duly considering the aspects of risk assessment and
    requirements of performance of additional work in line with the paragraphs 1 2 and 18.
31. An auditor shall also consider, while determining the qualitative materiality aspects, the probable
    impact of the significant factors enumerated in paragraph 13 , that may result in enhancement of the
    responsibility and hence, the work to be performed by the auditor.

#### Assessing the need for involving auditor’s expert(s).................................................................................

32. In addition to the requirements of the respective AAOIFI SOAA^30 , an auditor shall ensure that the
    audit team includes adequate subject-matter expert(s) suitable for an audit of financial statements
    of an IFI. The subject-matter expert(s) shall have a reasonable understanding of:

(^29) See paragraphs 21- 22 and 29-33 (particularly paragraph 32) of [ED of] SOAA 1 “Framework of Auditing”
(^30) Paragraphs 34-38 of [ED of] SOAA 1 “Framework of Auditing”

a. Shari’ah principles and rules; and

b. accounting and financial reporting requirements for IFIs, particularly those relevant to
Shari’ah principles and rules^31.

33. While it would generally be considered more appropriate that adequate involvement of the subject-
    matter expert(s) is ensured through suitable composition of the audit team, an auditor may consider
    using experts who are externally sourced to enable him to fulfil his responsibilities in connection
    with the audit. In addition, it may be relevant in certain circumstances to involve senior expert(s) in
    addition to the internally available resources, in order to address any higher level of unmitigated
    audit risks, as appropriate. In case of the use of an external subject-matter expert, an auditor shall
    preferably consider suitable fit and proper criteria^32.
34. The nature, timing and extent of the auditor’s procedures, as well as, the competence, capabilities
    and objectivity of the subject-matter expert(s) shall be commensurate with the overall planning and
    risk assessment performed in line with the requirements of this standard and the AAOIFI auditing
    framework.

#### Reliance on the work performed by SSB

35. In addition to the specific requirements of respective AAOIFI SOAA^33 , an auditor, at a minimum,
    shall:

a. review the SSB’s report(s) (annual or periodic, as applicable), in line with the requirements
of respective AAOIFI GS^34 ;

b. review the minutes of the meetings of SSB held during the period; and

c. review the resolutions and Fatwas issued during the period (and those issued earlier, having
relevance to the transactions and balances reported in the current financial statements, to
the extent deemed adequate).

36. In the event that the report referred to in paragraph 35 is not available (even in draft form) or does
    not include the relevant reporting requirements as contained in the respective AAOIFI GS^35 , an
    auditor shall assess the need for:

a. requesting a specific confirmation / representation from the SSB in this regard; and / or

b. requesting a meeting or other form of direct communication with the SSB.

37. The procedures selected by an auditor for the purpose of placing reliance on the work performed by
    the SSB and the SSB report depend on his professional judgment and assessment of the risks of

(^31) See Chapter 1 of AAOIFI Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting (Revised 2020)
(^32) This may, e.g., include the fit and proper criteria defined by the respective RSA or determined in line with the
requirements of the respective AAOIFI GS as applicable to senior level Shari’ah compliance / advisory positions, e.g., the
criteria applicable to a head of internal Shari’ah audit, head of Shari’ah compliance department or a SSB member (or
SSB advisor).
(^33) See paragraph 39 of [ED of] SOAA 1 “Framework of Auditing”
(^34) AAOIFI GS 21 “Shari’ah Supervisory Board: Review and Report”
(^35) AAOIFI GS 21 “Shari’ah Supervisory Board: Review and Report”

material non-compliance with Shari’ah principles and rules. In making those risk assessments, an
auditor shall consider, and test the design and implementation of, the governance framework
applicable to the SSB, in order to determine the extent of reliance to be placed, but not for the
purpose of expressing an opinion or commenting on the effectiveness or competence of SSB.

#### Reliance on the work performed by the external Shari’ah auditor

38. Extent of reliance on the work performed by the external Shari’ah auditor shall be determined, in
    line with the following:

a. in case the auditor (or his firm) also performs as external Shari’ah auditor – the auditor shall
review and extensively use the work performed and conclusions reached during the external
Shari’ah audit engagement, and ensure that the report in respect of external Shari’ah audit
is issued prior to, or at least simultaneously with, the auditor’s report in order to avoid any
inconsistency of opinion; and

b. in other cases – the auditor shall perform a quality assessment of such external Shari’ah
audit and review of the report and other communications by the external Shari’ah auditor
with the management, TCWG and organs of Shari’ah governance, and ensure that the
external Shari’ah auditor’s report is available before, or at the time of, issuing his auditor’s
report.

### Execution

#### Minimum substantive procedures in respect of compliance with Shari’ah principles and rules

39. Unless the risk assessment in respect of compliance with Shari’ah principles and rules requires
    additional procedures to be performed, an auditor shall perform the minimum substantive
    procedures enumerated in paragraphs 40 - 46.
40. An auditor shall perform the following audit procedures to help identify instances of non-compliance
    with other Shari’ah principles and rules that may have a material effect on the financial statements:

a. confirming with the management and, where appropriate, TCWG, as to whether the
institution is in compliance with Shari’ah principles and rules;

b. confirming with the respective organs of Shari’ah governance, and by way of reviewing their
reports to establish, as to whether the institution is in compliance with Shari’ah principles
and rules;

c. inspecting correspondence, if any, with the relevant RSAs.

#### Non-compliance brought to the auditor’s attention by other audit procedures

41. General audit procedures applied to form an opinion on the financial statements may bring
    instances of non-compliance or suspected non-compliance with Shari’ah principles and rules to the
    auditor’s attention. For example, such audit procedures may include:

a. reading minutes of management committees, TCWG, SSB and other organs of governance;

b. reading internal reports of different governance and control functions;

c. checking with the institution’s management and in-house Shari’ah compliance department
and / or external Shari’ah auditor concerning significant Shari’ah non-compliance issues and
potential control lapses;

d. reviewing the activity of the charity fund and other instances of charity, purification of
income and reversal of transactions, etc.; and

e. performing substantive tests of details of classes of transactions, account balances or
disclosures.

#### Audit procedures when non-compliance is identified or suspected

42. If an auditor becomes aware of an instance of non-compliance or information regarding a potential
    or suspected non-compliance with Shari’ah principles and rules, he shall obtain an understanding
    and further evidence:

a. in respect of the nature of the act and the circumstances in which it has occurred;

b. enabling him to further evaluate as to whether such instance is a possible indication of a
series of such or similar instances, or has an impact on the overall control environment and
the respective risk assessment;

c. enabling him to further evaluate the possible effect of such instance or series of instances on
the financial statements; and

d. enabling him to perform a macro-level assessment of the possible effect of such instance or
series of instances, on the institution’s overall state of compliance with Shari’ah principles
and rules.

43. If an auditor suspects there may be non-compliance, he shall discuss the matter with the
    appropriate level of management, respective organs of Shari’ah governance and, where appropriate,
    TCWG. If management or, as appropriate, TCWG do not provide sufficient information that supports
    that the institution is in compliance with Shari’ah principles and rules and, in his judgment, the effect
    of the suspected non-compliance may be material to the financial statements, the auditor shall
    consider the need to, firstly, obtain a specific opinion / representation from the SSB and, secondly,
    involve the auditor’s subject-matter expert.
44. If sufficient information about suspected non-compliance cannot be obtained, the auditor shall
    evaluate the effect of the lack of sufficient appropriate audit evidence on the auditor’s opinion
    (including both the truth and fairness opinion and the Shari’ah compliance opinion).

#### having a direct effect on the financial statements Additional procedures to identify instances of non-compliance with Shari’ah principles and rules – not

#### rules – not having a direct effect on the financial statements

45. Certain Shari’ah principles and rules may need specific consideration in an audit of financial
    statements due to having a fundamental effect on the operations of the institution, even though the
    same may not have an impact on the financial statements of the institution. Non-compliance with
    such Shari’ah principles and rules that have a fundamental effect on the operations of the institution
    may cause the institution to:

a. face severe reputation risk impacting the eventual operational and financial performance;

b. be subjected to punitive actions by RSAs; and / or

c. cease operations or call into question the institution’s status as a going concern.

46. Generally, the audit procedures required as per AAOIFI auditing framework, including in particular
    those required by this standard, would reasonably be expected to bring to the auditor’s attention
    instances of non-compliance with Shari’ah principles and rules that may or may not have a material
    effect on the financial statements. Nevertheless, an auditor is expected to perform reasonable
    additional audit procedures to address the risks identified in this respect.

### Considerations of fraud and error

#### Professional scepticism

47. In addition to the general requirements applicable to an auditor under the AAOIFI auditing
    framework regarding his responsibility to detect fraud and error, it is important that an auditor shall
    apply professional scepticism in matters relating to Shari’ah principles and rules, which are also
    susceptible to significant fraud and error risks.
48. An auditor shall consider, and appropriately incorporate in his audit procedures, that in certain
    situations such susceptibility to fraud and error may increase due to financial pressures, weak
    internal controls, system deficiencies / limitations and lack of adequately trained human resources
    assigned with the respective responsibilities.
49. An auditor, in no case, is expected to place reliance solely on the functions and reports of SSB and
    other relevant organs of Shari’ah governance, without application of professional scepticism and
    fulfilling other relevant requirements of this standard.
50. The following matters, in particular, would require the auditor to apply professional scepticism:

a. unjust or illegitimate advantage to or against the counterparties, particularly, in case of
participatory transactions or structures, e.g., intentional or unintentional misallocation of
profits and losses in the case of profit and loss distribution;

b. breach of contractual obligations and non-compliance of Shari’ah principles and rules in
respect of establishing rights and obligations of the parties, e.g., not passing on the due
benefits to the customers or claiming illegitimate amounts from them;

c. misuse of funds provided by the participatory stakeholders including violation of contracts,
or passing on undue losses to them;

d. concealing or omitting facts by the management in respect of certain activities and relevant
information to the auditors, SSB, TCWG, other organs of governance, participatory
stakeholders and shareholders;

e. misleading the SSB through concealing certain facts about a matter of significance, resulting
in a misinformed Shari’ah ruling or decision^36 ;

f. repeated violation and / or misinterpretation of Shari’ah principles and rules; and

g. manipulation of documents and records particularly those pertaining to the sequence of
Islamic finance transactions.

### Other significant considerations during the conduct of an audit

#### Written representations

51. An auditor shall request management and, where appropriate, TCWG, to provide written
    representations in such form and contents as considered suitable. Such written representations
    shall, at least, include the requirements for a management’s statement in respect of compliance
    with Shari’ah principles and rules, as illustrated by the respective AAOIFI SOAA^37.
52. In certain circumstances an auditor may need to evaluate the implications of identified or suspected
    non-compliance with Shari’ah principles and rules on the reliability of written representations
    received from management and, where applicable, TCWG. These, inter-alia, may include the
    situations whereby the auditor suspects or has evidence in respect of:

a. the involvement or intended involvement of the management and, where applicable, TCWG
in any identified or suspected non-compliance;

b. the concealment of facts from respective organs of Shari’ah governance, particularly, the
SSB; and

c. the management and, where applicable, TCWG having knowledge of such non-compliances
and, contrary to the requirements of respective Shari’ah governance framework, not taking
necessary actions to resolve such matter.

### Unique aspects of an IFI’s audit – due to business model / product structures

53. Audit of an IFI, from the perspective of Shari’ah compliance considerations, may have certain unique
    aspects due to the nature of contractual relationships in line with Shari’ah principles and rules. In
    addition, these may have certain specific requirements according to the fiduciary responsibilities
    (and stewardship requirements), on the management and TCWG, as applicable, according to the
    nature of the business model of the institution or the respective transaction structure. These
    fiduciary responsibilities, at times, may not be segregated from the fundamental Shari’ah
    compliance requirements. On the other hand, due to their impacts on the rights and obligations of
    the respective parties and transparency considerations, these may have direct impact on the
    financial reporting requirements for the IFI.

(^36) AAOIFI GS 18 “Shari’ah Decision-Making Process”
(^37) See Appendix B2 of SOAA 6 “External Shari’ah Audit (Independent Assurance Engagement on an IFI’s Compliance
with Shari’ah principles and rules)”

54. Accordingly, an auditor is expected to give due consideration to all such aspects in an audit of an IFI,
    including, but not limited to, the following:^38

a. general stewardship and fiduciary responsibilities – whereby it is expected that an IFI (as a
whole, and its management and TCWG in particular) fulfil the general stewardship
requirements and fiduciary responsibilities, not only towards the common shareholders, but
also towards other (particularly, the participatory) stakeholders. Such responsibilities may
include:

i. related parties – to be dealt (and also the respective transactions to be reported) on
a fair and transparent basis; and

ii. equitable treatment of stakeholders, particularly participatory stakeholders, by
having due audit consideration for profit and loss sharing, surplus and deficit
determination, reserves management, etc., considering the contractual compliance,
computation, valuation and measurement and fair and transparent disclosures;

b. specific funds management and reporting – whereby it is expected that an auditor of an IFI
shall give due consideration to such specific funds which are created according to the unique
business model of the IFI, regarding the compliance with Shari’ah principles and rules and
contractual obligations, fulfilment of fiduciary responsibilities and transparent and fair
financial reporting (irrespective of quantitative materiality). These may include the
following:

i. charity fund / obligations;

ii. Zakah fund / obligations; and

iii. Qard fund;

c. off-balance-sheet assets under management – which are kept and reported on an off-
balance-sheet basis, in line with the respective financial reporting framework, and hence
may be susceptible to more than ordinary risk of non-fulfilment of Shari’ah compliance or
contractual requirements, risk of unfair and non-transparent reporting (particularly, at
times, in consideration of the overall materiality) and risk of failure to fulfil fiduciary
responsibilities; and

d. completeness and relevance of information – whereby certain information that may not be
considered relevant for a conventional financial institution or any other institution / entity,
may be relevant for fair and transparent reporting, in the context of an audit of an IFI, due to
Shari’ah compliance considerations or the fiduciary responsibility element.

(^38) While certain core principles for such audit considerations have been summarised in this section, it is expected that
in due course appropriate detailed guidelines may be issued in this respect by AAOIFI Governance and Ethics Board
(AGEB).

### Documentation and archiving

55. An auditor shall appropriately document (and include audit evidence in the audit documentation)
    the following:

a. any identified or suspected non-compliance with Shari’ah principles and rules;

b. the audit procedures performed, the significant professional judgments made and the
conclusions reached thereon; and

c. the discussions of significant matters related to the non-compliance with management,
TCWG, SSB and others, including how management and, where applicable, TCWG and / or
SSB have responded to the matter.

56. The auditor’s documentation of findings regarding identified or suspected non-compliance with
    Shari’ah principles and rules may include, for example:

a. copies of records or documents; or

b. minutes of discussions held with management, TCWG, SSB or parties outside the institution.

57. Law, regulation or relevant ethical requirements may also set out additional documentation
    requirements regarding identified or suspected non-compliance with Shari’ah principles and rules.

### Conclusion of an audit

#### Communicating with TCWG on identified or suspected non-compliance

58. An auditor shall communicate with TCWG matters involving non-compliance with Shari’ah principles
    and rules that come to the auditor’s attention during the course of the audit, other than when the
    matters are clearly inconsequential. It is, however, essential that the views of the SSB of the
    institution are obtained in respect of such matters before (or at the time of) communicating the
    same to TCWG. Such communication shall normally take place at the time of, or near, the conclusion
    of the audit.
59. If, in the auditor’s judgment, the non-compliance referred to in paragraph 58 is believed to be
    intentional and material, the auditor shall communicate the matter with the SSB and TCWG as soon
    as practicable.

#### Communication with SSB and making the auditor’s draft report available

60. While concluding an audit, in addition to the requirements of respective AAOIFI SOAA^39 , an auditor
    shall appropriately coordinate and communicate with SSB, through management, whereby the
    following considerations shall apply:

a. an auditor shall consult with the SSB regarding specific opinions, approvals and rulings about
the matters where adequately documented Shari’ah principles and rules have not been
made available, or may need interpretation, or where he needs the SSB’s views on his
observations and instances of Shari’ah non-compliance noted during the course of the audit;

(^39) See paragraphs 113-117 of [ED of] SOAA 1 “Framework of Auditing”

b. an auditor shall obtain the draft report of the SSB, and consider any impact of the matters
addressed in the same on the work performed and conclusions reached during the audit;

c. prior to issuance of the final report of the SSB, an auditor shall make available to the SSB his
draft report and conclusions related to compliance with Shari’ah principles and rules; and

d. the auditor shall appropriately take into account any corrective measures suggested by the
SSB, and their effect on the conclusions reached.

#### Reporting identified or suspected non-compliance to an appropriate authority outside the institution

61. If the auditor has identified or suspects material / substantive / systematic non-compliance with
    Shari’ah principles and rules, the auditor shall determine whether law, regulation or relevant ethical
    requirements:

a. require the auditor to report to an appropriate authority outside the institution (which may
include the respective RSA or the respective central Shari’ah board (CSB)); or

b. establish responsibilities under which reporting to an appropriate authority outside the
institution may be appropriate in the circumstances.

## Auditor’s report

### Truth and fairness opinion – potential implications of identified or suspected non-compliance

62. If the auditor concludes that the identified or suspected non-compliance of Shari’ah principles and
    rules has a material effect on the financial statements that has not been adequately reflected, the
    auditor shall, in accordance with the requirements of AAOIFI auditing framework (including the
    relevant requirements of EPAs) express a qualified opinion or an adverse opinion on the financial
    statements.
63. If the auditor is precluded by management or TCWG from obtaining sufficient appropriate audit
    evidence to evaluate whether a non-compliance of Shari’ah principles and rules that may be
    material to the financial statements has, or is likely to have, occurred, the auditor shall express a
    qualified opinion or disclaim an opinion on the financial statements on the basis of a limitation on
    the scope of the audit in accordance with the requirements of AAOIFI auditing framework (including
    the relevant requirements of EPAs).
64. If the auditor is unable to determine whether a non-compliance of Shari’ah principles and rules has
    occurred because of limitations imposed by the circumstances rather than by the management or
    TCWG, the auditor shall evaluate the effect on the auditor’s opinion in accordance with AAOIFI
    auditing framework (including the relevant requirements of EPAs).

### Shari’ah governance Shari’ah compliance opinion – reference to the placement of reliance on SSB and other functions of

## other functions of Shari’ah governance

65. An auditor’s Shari’ah compliance opinion may also be affected by the circumstances identified in
    paragraphs 62 - 64 and a modification of the auditor’s report in this respect shall also become
    necessary, accordingly.
66. For the purpose of forming the Shari’ah compliance opinion, an auditor may rely, as appropriate, on
    the following:

a. the function and report of SSB for the period;

b. the report of the external Shari’ah auditor (if any) for the period;

c. the internal Shari’ah audit function and its reports as relevant to the period; and

d. the overall Shari’ah compliance function and the Shari’ah compliance department’s reports
as relevant to the period.

67. A reference shall be made in the auditor’s report of the fact that such reliance has been placed, for
    the purpose of forming the auditor’s Shari’ah compliance opinion, in line with the requirements of
    the AAOIFI auditing framework.

## Effective date

68. This standard shall be effective for audits of financial statements for periods beginning on or after 1
    January 2027. Earlier application is allowed, if SOAA 1 “Framework of Auditing” is also adopted
    simultaneously.

## Amendments to other standards

69. This standard supersedes the existing SOAA 4 “Testing for Compliance with Shari’ah Rules and
    Principles by an External Auditor”.

## Appendix B: Basis for conclusions

[To be updated later]

## Appendix C: Brief history of the preparation of the standard

H1 AAOIFI Governance and Ethics Board (AGEB / the board) initiated the auditing standards revision
project in 2019, with an objective of updating and improving the auditing standards issued by AAOIFI
in light of Shari’ah principles and rules and the latest established practices of auditing (EPAs). The
task was delegated to a dedicated committee, namely Auditing and Assurance Standards Committee
(AASC)^40 comprising of members and nominees from both AGEB and AAOIFI Accounting Board
(AAB).

H2 After issuance of the exposure draft of AAOIFI Standard on Auditing and Assurance (SOAA) 1
“Framework of Auditing”, AASC, in its 11th meeting held on 27 Rabi’ II 1446H, corresponding to 30
October 2024, discussed and recommended the outline and contents of the exposure draft of this
standard.

H3 The exposure draft of the standard was discussed during the 41st AAB meeting, held on 30 Rabi II
1446H, corresponding to 2 November 2024, whereby AAB, in principle, agreed with the overall
approach and contents of the standard with specific comments for improvement and also agreed
that the members will provide additional comments in due course through circulation.

H4 AASC, in its 12th meeting held on 22 Jumada I 1446H, corresponding to 24 November 2024, reviewed
and agreed on the principles and requirements embedded in the standard and recommended the
exposure draft for perusal of AGEB.

H5 The exposure draft of the standard was presented to AGEB in its two different meetings, i.e., 39th
and 40th meetings, held on 3 Jumada I 1446H and 9 Jumada II 1446H, corresponding to 5 November
2024 and 10 December 2024 respectively. The board, accordingly, approved the overall approach
and contents of the standard, as well as, the final version of the exposure draft of the standard, in
two different stages, respectively.

H6 The exposure draft of the standard was issued after incorporation of the boards’ comments and
completion of necessary formalities on 25 Jumada II 144 6 H, corresponding to 26 December 202 4 ,
inviting public comments thereon.
